# March 22 Weekly Update

Little progress was made over spring break, but we have been working towards the
following goals for Monday. We will update accordingly on Monday as well.

__Omkar__
  - Set up Raspberry Pi for use on CMU network (some issues still)
  - Goal: finish toy training data set image collection
  - Goal: finish implementation of image segmentation, finding a bounding box
    around the toy
  - Goal: finish implementation of HOGS (histogram of gradients)
    feature extraction. This will be used to find the shape of the outline
    of the toy
  - Goal: help Chris with arrangmenet and routing of PCB design

__Chris__
  - Goal: Finish 2nd iteration of PCB design schematic including port expander chips
    with SPI lines and add JST connectors for output to solenoids
  - Goal: begin arrangement and routing of PCB design

__Tara__
  - Attended Professor Savvides pattern recognition lectures
  - Set up Raspberry Pi camera
  - Goal: Begin work on toy training data set image collection. Specifically,
    determine how to make a consistently lit white background inside the box as
    a backdrop for the toys. Additionally, test how sharp images from a Raspberry
    Pi camera can be.
  - Goal: Draw out the pipeline for example of feature extraction
