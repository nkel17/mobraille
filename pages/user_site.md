Alternatively, you could use the procedure I described for
[making an independent website](independent_site.html). The only thing
you do differently is to use the `master` branch rather than a
`gh-pages` branch.

A final note: the `404.html` file will serve as the &ldquo;page not
found&rdquo; page for _all_ of your GitHub Pages (that is, if you
_want_ a personalized 404 page).

### Up next

Now go to [making a project site](project_site.html).
