Mobraille is an object-to-Braille device that is scoped to classify
three different toys and articulate their names in Braille. Mobraille will
enable blind children to begin to see the world.

## Why Mobraille?

Students with vision impairment often struggle in educational settings as most
devices used to teach the blind are prohibitively expensive. Furthermore,
braille keyboards and refreshable displays are limited to the cyber world.
Mobraille extends learning opportunities to the physical world.

## Current tasks
* Image data set collection
* Color moments feature extraction implementation
* PCB Design Iteration (2)
